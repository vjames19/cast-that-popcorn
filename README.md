=================

Manage all your high definition digital movies and cast them all to your Chromecast! Don't limit yourself to Netflix's catalog; "Cast That Popcorn" is a media center in the cloud, your personal Netflix with movies provided by yourself.

By using your own server, you can upload a movie by any method you prefer. If you have a BitTorrent client installed, you can give us a torrent file and we will queue it for download on your server automatically! Then just watch the download as it quickly progresses. When it's finished, you can play your newly stored movie directly to your TV by using your Chromecast!

Finally, On-demand movies without limits, absolutely free!
